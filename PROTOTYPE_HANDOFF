# [PROTOTYPE HANDOFF] :: [Feature Name]

**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Owner:** Prototype Engineer

## 1. Demo
- **Live Endpoint URL:** `[Link to the deployed prototype]`
- **Postman Collection:** [`/docs/postman/prototype_collection.json`](./docs/postman/prototype_collection.json)
- **Brief Description:** A summary of what the prototype demonstrates.

## 2. Key Learnings & Friction Points
A bulleted list of discoveries made during the prototype phase.
- *Example: The external API for X has a higher latency than expected.*
- *Example: The database connection requires SSL, which was not initially documented.*

## 3. Documented Shortcuts & Technical Debt
This is the official backlog of work required to make the prototype production-ready.

| Shortcut Taken                                       | Recommended Production Solution (TODO)                               |
|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| JWT secret is hardcoded in the source code.          | Refactor to read `JWT_SECRET_KEY` from the environment.              |
| No input validation on the `/register` endpoint.     | Implement Pydantic models for request body validation.               |
| Used an in-memory dictionary as the database.        | Integrate with the real PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.        |
