## 1. Executive Summary
A high-level summary of the testing results and a final recommendation.

- **Overall Status:** `[PASS | PASS with issues | FAIL]`
- **Recommendation:** `[Ready for Release | Conditionally Ready (address new bugs) | Not Ready (blocker bugs found)]`
- **Quality Summary:** *A brief sentence summarizing the quality of the features tested. Example: "The core registration and login flows are stable, but a critical issue was found in the password reset functionality."*

## 2. Test Execution Summary
A table summarizing the results of the planned testing activities.

| Test Type             | Scenarios Planned | Scenarios Executed | Pass | Fail |
|-----------------------|-------------------|--------------------|------|------|
| **End-to-End (E2E)** | 3                 | 3                  | 2    | 1    |
| **Performance** | 1                 | 1                  | 1    | 0    |
| **Exploratory** | 1 Charter         | 1 Session          | -    | -    |

## 3. Detailed Results

### End-to-End (E2E) Scenarios
- ✅ **PASS:** Scenario 1: Successful User Registration and Login
- ❌ **FAIL:** Scenario 2: Attempted Access with Invalid Credentials
  - **Failure Details:** The API returned a `500 Internal Server Error` instead of a `401 Unauthorized` error message.
- ✅ **PASS:** Scenario 3: Unauthorized Access to Protected Route

### Performance Test
- ✅ **PASS:** The `POST /token` endpoint maintained an average response time of **182ms** under load, meeting the <200ms goal.

## 4. New Defects Found
A list of all new bugs discovered during this sprint's testing cycle. This list should be used to create new `[BUG]` tasks in the main `tasks.yml` backlog.

| Bug ID (Proposed) | Severity | Title                                       | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|----------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BUG-001`         | `High`   | Incorrect error code on failed login        | The API returns a 500 error instead of a 401 on incorrect password submission. |
| `BUG-002`         | `Medium` | Registration form allows invalid email format | The API accepts emails without an "@" symbol, which should be rejected.     |

## 5. Final Assessment
Based on the results, the core functionality is working, but the failed E2E test and the new bugs found require attention before a production release. The recommendation is **Conditionally Ready**.
